                <p>Software development practices have evolved quickly in recent years. Technologies like

                <h3>Docker Containerisation</h3>
                <h3>What to containerise and what not to containerise</h3>

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>I was starting from a point where my local development and remote production environments consisted
                    of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Various Apache httpd webservers on laptop, desktop, RPi and EC2 instances.</li>
                    <li>Each web server with tightly coupled LAMP stack modules such as PHP interpreter and MySQL
                        Server.</li>
                    <li>Each web server configured to serve multiple project sites.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How could migration to containerisation change my development workflows?</li>
                    <li>What will my adoption path look like?</li>
                    <li>Would I have to rewrite source code to adapt web applications to a new development and
                        production
                        environments?</li>

                </ul>

                <p>My research learning process was roughly this:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Read a book.</li>
                    <li>Browse through some online <a href="https://docs.docker.com/" title="links to docker docs"
                            target="_blank">docker
                            docs</a> documentation.</li>
                    <li>Watch some online videos.</li>
                    <li>Install Docker and do the practice exercises from the book.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The following is a brief discussion of one issue raised by that research learning process,
                    regarding
                    my migration to the Docker system of containerisation.</p>

                <h4>A Docker Migration Issue</h4>
                <p>In my current development environment, each webserver has been configured with a Name-Based virtual
                    host (vhost) for each site project. Apparently, one of the reasons the Apache webserver first became
                    so popular on the web was this ability to host serveral isolated web sites on the same physical
                    host, using the concept of virtual hosts.</p>

                <p>Questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can this useful Name-Based virtual hosting practice be migrated to a containerised web server?
                        Does it need
                        to be?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>A Brief Review of my local DNS Resolution and Virtual Hosting</h4>
                <p>I'll now briefly review how a development website hosted on my local network is accessed from any
                    browser on the same network. The same would apply to a browser and webserver on the same
                    physical host machine.</p>

                <p>When I enter the URL of a site hosted on my local network into the browsers' address bar, there
                    must be use some local DNS resolution of
                    the hostname part. There are a stack of dns resolution options. Closest to the user and taking
                    precedence are
                    the translations defined in the <samp>/etc/hosts</samp> configuration file. If an entry here
                    resolves what's been entered into the browser into a local IP address, then the network stack of
                    that
                    browser process has its' answer and can assign destination addresses to IP packets. The HTTP
                    <samp>Host:</samp> header can also now be assigned that hostname value we entered. Let's assume
                    that was successful.
                </p>

                <p>Next, smoothing over the fine details, a request for the web page gets sent over the network (or
                    down, then back up the <samp>localhost</samp> loopback interface) to the device that hosts the
                    webserver, where an Apache daemon is always listening for such incoming requests on the one or more
                    configured ports. These port are configured using the <samp>Listen</samp> directive, for example
                    <samp>Listen 80</samp>.
                </p>

                <p>Next, in my setups, with Name-Based virtual hosting, the hostname value assigned to the
                    <samp>Host:</samp> header is used
                    by the Apache webserver to decide to which virtual host to direct the request.
                </p>

                <p>Without getting into the NAT-like interfaces involved, let's contrast that process with one in which
                    those webservers are containerised. There are two
                    principles of containerisation could prevent my hosts' <samp>/etc/hosts</samp> configuration file
                    from
                    participating in the process...</p>

                <h4>A Couple of Fundamental Principles of Containerisation</h4>

                <p>If I've understood it correctly, implementations of Containerisation must preserve: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Isolation of container environments from host machine environment.</li>
                    <li>Independence of container environments from any particular host set up, as
                        containers should 'run anywhere', regardless of host configuration.</li>
                </ul>


                <h4>Migration of my Virtual Hosts Configuration into Docker Images</h4>

                <p>With those principles in mind, might I have a Docker containerisation migration/adoption issue?</p>

                <p>Without <samp>/etc/hosts</samp> (or any other host configuration file) I'd be restricted to only
                    entering either an IP
                    address or the <code>localhost</code> value that gets preconfigured on all
                    Linux-based systems.
                    So using <code>localhost</code> would be fine, but with IP address only, my Apache webservers won't
                    be
                    able to route
                    incoming packets to their correct Name-Based Virtual Host destinations.</p>

                <p>Note also, that a port number specified in a <code>localhost</code> request gets packets to the
                    correct running webserver
                    container, but what
                    then? It seems that when requests come from anywhere outside the container network,
                    each containerised webserver can only possibly serve a single site.</p>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                <p>As far as I can see at the moment, the Name-Based virtual hosting that I've used to serve
                    multiple sites from each Apache webserver <em>cannot be migrated over to a container-based
                        environments</em>. If so, I shouldn't waste time trying to craft images of Apache
                    webservers configured with multiple virtually hosted sites. Phew!</p>

                <p>Update: Ok, perhaps that conclusion is
                    moot, since another key principle of Containerisation is that each container should provide a single
                    service only.</p>

                <p> Ahh... Ok. Never mind then. Nice chat anyway.</p>
