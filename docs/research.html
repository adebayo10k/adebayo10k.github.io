                <p>Software development practices have evolved quickly in recent years. Technologies like
                    containerisation have matured and become best practices, monolithic applications being replaced by

                <h3>Docker Containerisation</h3>
                <h3>What to containerise and what not to containerise</h3>

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>I was starting from a point where my local development and remote production environments consisted
                    of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apache webservers on laptop, desktop and RPi hosts.</li>
                    <li>Each web server with tightly coupled LAMP stack modules such as PHP interpreter and MySQL
                        Server.</li>
                    <li>Each web server configured to serve multiple project sites.</li>
                    <li>Public cloud compute deployments that replicate that "traditional" environment, which some
                        additional "production" configurations.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How much of my existing development environment would have to change if I embraced the new
                        modular, container-based software development?</li>
                    <li>What will my adoption path look like?</li>
                    <li>Would I have to rewrite source code to adapt the web applications to a new development
                        environment?</li>
                    <li>How would my development workflows change?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>My research learning process was roughly this:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Read a book.</li>
                    <li>Browse through some online docker docs documentation.</li>
                    <li>Watch some online videos.</li>
                    <li>Install Docker and do the practice exercises from the book.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The following is a discussion of the main issue raised by that research learning process, regarding
                    my migration to the Docker system of containerisation.</p>

                <h4>A Docker Migration Issue</h4>
                <p>In my current development environment, each webserver has been configured with a name-based virtual
                    host (vhost) for each site project. Apparently, one of the reasons the Apache webserver first became
                    so popular on the web was this ability to host serveral isolated web sites on the same physical
                    host, using the concept of virtual hosts.</p>

                <p>Questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can this useful virtual hosting practice be migrated to a containerised web server? Does it need
                        to be?</li>
                    <li>What will my adoption path look like?</li>
                    <li>Or more specifically, how would I migrate project sites that are currently served on my local
                        network to adapt to development and collaboration with containers?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>A Brief Review of Local DNS Resolution and Virtual Hosting</h4>
                <p>I'll now briefly review how a development website hosted on my local network is accessed from any
                    browser on the same network. The same would apply even if the browser and webserver were on the same
                    physical host machine.</p>

                <p>The browser must resolve the URL (which includes a hostname) that I enter locally, usually on the
                    same host. We have a stack of dns resolution options. Closest to the user and taking precedence are
                    the translations defined in the <samp>/etc/hosts</samp> configuration file. If an entry here
                    resolves what's been entered into the browser into a local IP address, then the network stack of the
                    browser process has its' answer and can assign destination addresses to IP packets. Let's assume
                    that was successful.</p>

                <p>Next, smoothing over the fine details, a request for the web page gets sent over the network (or
                    down, then back up the <samp>localhost</samp> loopback interface) to the device that hosts the web
                    server, where an Apache daemon is always listening for such incoming requests on the one or more
                    configured ports. These port are configured using the <samp>Listen</samp> directive, for example
                    <samp>Listen 80</samp>.</p>

                <p>Next, in my setups, with name-based virtual hosting, the Hostname value in the request header is used
                    by the Apache web server to decide to which virtual host to direct the request.</p>

                <h4>A Couple of Fundamental Principles of Containerisation</h4>
                <p>Now contrast that process with what would happen in containerised development environment. How would
                    my colleagues browser send requests to the containerised web server that she's just pulled from my
                    repository and spun up in an isolated container on her local network?</p>

                <p>My point here is not to discuss the NAT-like interfaces involved, but just to highlight the
                    following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>One of the fundamental principles of Containerisation is isolation of container environments
                        from host machine environment. Only data volume mounts seem to breach this principle, however
                        that just seems so, as the docker engine has full awareness and control over any mounted part of
                        the host filesystem.</li>
                    <li>'Ad-hoc reconfiguration' of the host machine for each container project is also verboten, as
                        containers should 'run anywhere', regardless of host configuration.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Bearing these in mind, I think I have a migration/adoption issue..</p>

                <h4>Migration of my Virtual Hosts into Docker Images</h4>
                <p>If we're not able to recruit our host machines' <samp>/etc/hosts</samp> file aliases to translate
                    hostnames into an IP address, how would an HTTP requests' Hostname header be used by a containerised
                    Apache web server to route requests to the appropriate virtual host?</p>

                <p>The port number in the request gets the packets to the correct running web server container, but what
                    then? It currently seems to me that when requests come from anywhere outside the container network,
                    each containerised web server can only possibly serve a single site.</p>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>As far as I can see at the moment, the use of name-based virtual hosting that I've used to serve
                    multiple sites from each Apache webserver <em>cannot be migrated over to a container-based
                        development environment</em>. If so, I shouldn't waste time trying to craft images of Apache
                    webservers with multiple virtually hosted sites baked in. Phew! Anyway, perhaps this conclusion is
                    moot, because another key containerisation principle is that each container should provide a single
                    service only. Ahh, I get it now.</p>
