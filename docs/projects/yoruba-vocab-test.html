                    </header>
                    <p>The system of writing the Yoruba language using latin-based characters was not the first, but for
                        historical reasons, has become our de facto standard.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the bus on which unicode code-points for latin characters were being standardised,
                        left about 20 years ago.</p>
                    <p>Thankfully, some smart unicode people developed the 'combining diacritical marks' workaround
                        (which I
                        won't go into on this page). Being a workaround however, and not a core standard, it's
                        implementation is far from universal.</p>

                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p> <em>The web</em> is now the way most of the world consumes it's written information - so, not so
                        much
                        the printed media anymore. Web and Information standards are the foundations of the stacks on
                        which
                        we're all building. But what happens when a language is not yet a standard part of that
                        foundation?
                    </p>
                    <p>So, my main 'interesting challenge' would be discovering for myself whether I could create a web
                        application whose source data was from a character set for which some unicode code-points do not
                        currently
                        exists. Eh?</p>

                        <h3>Unicode Normal Form</h3>
                        <p>Ok, just a bit about combining diacritical marks.</p>
                        <p>The latin character <kbd>é</kbd> has the unicode code-point <code>00e9</code>. The character <kbd>e</kbd> has the code-point <code>0065</code>. It's possible to encode <kbd>é</kbd> using the combined code sequence<code>00650301</code>, where the <code>0301</code>  is for combining the acute mark.  However, since a code-point is already available for <kbd>é</kbd>, it would not be in Unicode Normal Form. HTML validators would complain.</p>

                        <p>It's only possible to achieve Unicode Normal Form where a unicode code-point exists.</p>

                        <h3>Interpreting Unicode Characters</h3>

                        <p>
                            In the Linux world, the bash interpreter will take an unix hex unicode code-point from
                            <samp>stdin</samp> and
                            give
                            us back the corresponding unicode character in <samp>stdout</samp>:
                        </p>

                        <pre>
                        <samp><kbd>Ctrl + Shift + u 00e9</kbd></samp> <samp># outputs: é</samp>
                    </pre>

                        <pre>
                        <samp><kbd><span class="prompt">damola@host:~$</span> echo -e '\u00e9'</kbd></samp>
                        <samp># (as an escape sequence) outputs: é</samp>
                    </pre>

                        <p>
                            Developers need to be aware of which unicode hex formats are understood by the various
                            interpreters
                            that make up their web applications. For the Yoruba language character set, developers then
                            need
                            to
                            use reliable pipelines to encode,
                            decode, compress, encrypt, input, output, store and transmit data between these different
                            interpreters.</p>
                        <p>To be transmitted safely across the Internet, data needs to be encoded using schemes
                            like base64 or Unicode, then decoded by your application.</p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the default escape sequence formats I found were:
                        </p>
                        <p>unix hex unicode refs used by bash interpreters: <samp><kbd>\u00E9</kbd></samp></p>
                        <p>xml unicode code-point used by most interpreters: <samp><kbd>&amp;#x00E9;</kbd></samp></p>
                        <p>html cer used by browsers (which are interpreters): <samp><kbd>&amp;#233;</kbd></samp></p>
                        <p>unix-like unicode used by php interpreters: <samp><kbd>\u{00E9}</kbd></samp></p>

                        <p>
                            Then, there&apos;s the font support to consider. For reasons of efficiency, some font
                            families
                            like monospace are specifically designed to implement only core standard unicode. Even
                            correctly
                            decoded combining diacritical marks are therefore
                            rendered incorrectly by these fonts.
                        </p>

                        <p>As explained in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp"
                                title="Links to Mozzilla docs for samp element" target="_blank">Mozzilla docs</a>, some
                            HTML5
                            elements like <samp><kbd>&lt;samp&gt;</kbd></samp> are
                            typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font.</p>

                        <p>
                            Probably one for further research.</p>
                        <p>
                            At this point in the research, my excitement levels had become 'quite high'. The
                            opportunites to
                            develop services in this space seemed massive.

                        <p>
                            Next, I had the idea that the simplest form of application, in which the reliable
                            interpreting
                            of
                            these weird Yorùbá characters could be demonstrated, would be a language quiz app. Now doing
                            software development, I created a <a

                            It worked as expected. From that point, I was confident enough to start developing a web

                            nothing
                            changed or created by users, I could have got away with reading source data from a JSON
                            structured
                            data
                            file. Up to a point, this might even perform much better than database reads. However, by
                            this
                            point
                            I was beginning to develop
                            'big ideas' about
                            the destiny of this web app. No point delaying. Only full <abbr

                            functionality would do for where this
                            application was going! A MySQL relational database, now!

                            This 'minimum viable product' server-side web app implemented the Front Controller pattern,
                            with
                            one
                            main
                            page as the single entry point of control. The application was coded and database created
                            within
                            a local development environment. PHPUnit was installed locally to the project using the
                            Composer
                            dependency
                            manager, and used to conduct suites of unit tests on our classes and object methods as they
                            were
                            being
                            developed.

                        <p>Based on the application architecture I'd decided upon, but also as a bit of a
                            side-challenge, it
                            looked like I'd be utilising the <abbr
                                title="Infrastructure as a Service: A cloud service model implemented by cloud providers">IaaS</abbr>,
                            <abbr title="Public Cloud: A cloud deployment model, implemented by cloud providers">public
                                cloud</abbr> offerings provided by AWS. A Single EC2 hypervisor
                            instance was launched to virtualise an Ubuntu Linux server OS, on which an Apache
                            web server, configured with various modules, was built by hand (slow, but satisfying). So,
                            web
                            and database servers running on the same instance as the application itself should be enough
                            for
                            now. Or so I thought. I won't
                            go into that now.

                        <p>Being a server-side web application gives an inherent layer of security. The most sensitive
                            application code stays on the server. Additionally, the Apache 'Web Application
                            Firewall' module mod_security was installed as an Application Layer inspector of web
                            server traffic.</p>
