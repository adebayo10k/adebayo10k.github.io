                <p>This project is now deployed at <a href="http://yorubasystems.com"
                        title="bit emabarrassing, but this now takes you to a failover static page (http), until site back online"
                        target="_blank">yorubasystems.com</a>. The orginal scope of this project was for a
                    simple, online vocabulary quiz. This page is supposed to document the interesting parts of my
                    research and the software development
                    process.</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>

                <p>The system of writing the Yoruba language using latin-based characters was not the first, but for
                    historical reasons, has become our de facto standard.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the bus on which unicode code-points for latin characters were being standardised,
                    left about 20 years ago.</p>
                <p>Thankfully, some smart unicode people developed the 'combining diacritical marks' workaround (which I
                    won't go into on this page). Being a workaround however, and not a core standard, it's use in
                    today's 'web and information standards world' is not optimal.</p>


                <h3>The Challenge</h3>

                <p> <em>The web</em> is now the way most of the world consumes it's written information - so, not so
                    much
                    the printed media anymore. See the problem here? What happens when a language can't easily be
                    plugged into the web?</p>
                <p>So, my main 'interesting challenge' would be discovering for myself whether I could create a web
                    application whose source data was from a character set for which some unicode code-points do not currently
                    exists. Eh?</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>

                <p>
                    In the Linux world, the bash interpreter will take an unix hex unicode code-point from stdin and
                    give
                    us back the corresponding unicode character in stdout:
                </p>
                <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
                <span>+</span>
                <kbd>Shift</kbd>
                <span>+</span>
                <kbd>u</kbd>
                <kbd>0</kbd>
                <kbd>0</kbd>
                <kbd>e</kbd>
                <kbd>9</kbd>
                <span># outputs: é</span>

                <code>echo -e '\u00e9'	# (as an escape sequence) outputs: é</code>

                <p>
                    Developers need to be aware of which unicode hex formats are understood by the various interpreters
                    that make up their web applications. Developers then need to use reliable pipelines to encode,
                    decode, input, output, store and transmit
                    Yoruba language character set data between these different interpreters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some of the default escape sequence formats I found were:
                </p>

                <p>unix hex unicode refs used by bash interpreters:</p>
                <code>\u00E9</code>
                <p>xml unicode code-point used by most interpreters:</p>
                <code>&amp;#x00E9;</code>
                <p>html cer used by browsers (which are interpreters):</p>
                <pre>&amp;#233;</pre>
                <p>unix-like unicode used by php interpreter:</p>
                <code>\u{00E9}</code>

                <p>
                    Then, there&apos;s also the font support for this workaround to consider. Monospaced and most
                    specialist font families seem unable render even correctly decoded combining diacritical marks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this point in the research, my excitement levels had become 'quite high'.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I then had the idea that the simplest form of web application in which the reliable interpreting of
                    these weird Yoruba characters could be demonstrated, would be a language quiz app. Still 'doing
                    research', I then created a <a
                        href="https://github.com/adebayo10k/yoruba-language-quiz-prototype" title="to the github source code repository (opens in new tab)"
                        target="_blank">yoruba language quiz bash
                        shell program</a> as a kind of
                    prototype of how such an application would handle JSON source data like this:
                </p>

                <code>
{    
    "englishPhrase": "'hat'",
    "yorubaPhrase": "'fil\\u{00E0}'",
    "category": "",
    "shortAudioFile": ""
}
                </code>

                <p>
                    It worked as expected. From that point, I was confident enough to start developing a web
                    application,
                    briefly summarised as follows:
                </p>

                <h3>Application Architecture</h3>

                <p>Classic, monolithic, LAMP stack architecture would do for now. So, something like an Ubuntu Linux
                    server operating system would be running an Apache http server, on which PHP and MySQL modules would
                    need to be installed. All very tightly coupled, I know.</p>

                <h3>Database Design</h3>

                <p>
                    Entity Relationship modelling used to create a Data Model. For an app with static data, so nothing
                    changed or created by users, we could get away with reading the data from a JSON data structure. It
                    would even perform much better. However, by this point I was beginning to develop 'big ideas' about
                    the destiny of this web app. No point delaying. Only full CRUD functionality would do for where this
                    application was going! A MySQL relational database, now!
                </p>

                <h3>Application Software Development</h3>

                <p>UML techniques used to model the quiz domain.</p>

                <h3>Implementation</h3>

                <p>
                    The 'simple as possible' server-side web app implemented the Front Controller pattern, with one main
                    page as the single entry point of control. The application was coded and database created within
                    a local development environment. PHPUnit was installed locally using the Composer dependency
                    manager, then used to conduct unit testing on our classes.
                </p>

                <h3>Deployment on AWS Cloud</h3>
                <p>A Single EC2 hypervisor instance was used to virtualise an Ubuntu Linux server OS, on which Apache
                    web server was configured with various modules were built by hand (slow, but satisfying). So, web
                    and database servers running on the same instance should be enough for now. Or so I thought. I won't
                    go into that now.</p>

                <h3>Securing the Web App</h3>
                <p>Being a server-side web application gives an inherent layer of security. The Apache 'Web Application
                    Firewall' module mod_security was also installed as an additional Application Layer inspector of web
                    server traffic.</p>

                <h3>Monitoring the App</h3>
                <p>Web server logs, ubuntu server logs and AWS Cloudwatch.</p>

                <h3>Site Analytics and Testing</h3>
                <p>None yet.</p>
