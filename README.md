_"... a github.io subdomain with all :eight: bits set..."_


Welcome

I'm still deciding on the purpose of this repository (and the resulting github pages site). Seems like 'promoting' the content and the owner of this github account is it's natural purpose. Never been greatly comfortable with direct self-promotion, but... long story...

Thanks again to :octocat:
