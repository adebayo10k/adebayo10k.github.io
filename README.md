_"... a github.io subdomain with all :eight: bits set..."_


Welcome

I'm still deciding on the purpose of this repository (and the resulting github pages site).

Seems like 'promoting' the content and the owner of this github account is it's natural purpose.

Keep in mind it's apparently web server only, so no server-side web app code happening here.

Let's see what emerges...


Thanks again to :octocat:
